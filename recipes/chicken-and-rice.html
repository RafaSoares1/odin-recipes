  <h3>Description</h3>
<p>Be like the prince of the Saiyans and enjoy this dish. 
  This oven baked Chicken and Rice recipe has captured the hearts of people all around the world!The rice absorbs the chicken juices as it cooks, adding loads of flavour.
   It’s like cooking the rice with the power of Vegeta!!</p>

   <p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   </p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Bone in chicken thighs </li>
<li> White rice</li>
<li> Chicken seasoning like paprika</li>
<li> Water</li>
<li> Garlic</li>
<li> Butter</li>
</ul>

  </p>

  <p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li> Skin on, bone in chicken thighs is best for this recipe because they take the same length of time to cook in the oven as the rice – 50 minutes in total. However, we remove the skin because otherwise the fat drips down into the rice as it cooks which makes it overly greasy.
           It’s easy – it’s effortless and takes 5 seconds flat per chicken.
          </li>
        
        <li>Uncooked white rice – any “normal” white rice will work just fine here (plain, long grain, short grain, Jasmin, basmati). Steer clear of speciality rices like paella or risotto rice – they cook differently in the oven.
           Brown rice just needs more liquid and to be cooked a bit longer – directions are in the recipe;</li>
        <li>Butter, garlic & onion flavour base – this forms the flavour base for the rice and because this recipe is all about convenience, we “oven saute” them – fancy word for just throw it all in a pan and bake instead of sautéing on the stove! See photos below and the quick recipe video.

        </li>
        <li>The rice is outrageously good. It’s buttery and garlicky, it’s tender but not mushy (I’m of Japanese background, all Asians are snobs when it comes to rice).
           It’s got all the flavour from the juices of the chicken and you get crispy bits on the edges that I just want to pick off and have all to myself! Enjoy and share some of this food with Bulma and Trunks.</li>
          </ol>
