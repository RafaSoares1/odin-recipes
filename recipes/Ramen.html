  <h3> Description</h3>
  <p>The most traditional Dragon Ball dish and Goku's favorite (but he eats everything to be honest). Easy homemade chicken ramen, with a flavorful broth, roasted chicken, fresh veggies, lots of noodles, and a soft cooked egg.
     Inspired by traditional Japanese ramen, but on the table in under an hour.

  <p> 
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  </p>
  <p> 
    <ul>
      <li> 2 chicken breasts</li>
      <li> 1 Tbsp unsalted butter </li>
      <li> 2 tsp sesame or vegetable oi</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp fresh garlic, minced</li>
      <li> 4 cups rich chicken stock </li>
      <li> 1 oz dried shitake mushrooms</li>
      <li> 2 large eggs</li>
      <li> 1–2 tsp sea salt, to taste</li>
      <li> 2 (3 oz) packs dried ramen noodles</li>
      <li> optional: fresh jalapeño or chili slices, for serving</li>
    
  
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
<ol>
<li> Preheat the oven to 375℉. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.
  Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. Flip the chicken over and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.
  </li>

<li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for a few minutes until softened. Add the soy sauce and mirin, and stir to combine. 
  Cook for another minute.</li>
<li>Fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs, and bring to a boil. Gently lower the eggs (still cold from the fridge) into the boiling water, and let simmer for 7 minutes (for a slightly-runny yolk) or 8 minutes (for a soft, but set-up yolk).

</li>
<li>Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two large bowls. Add the sliced chicken and the ramen broth. Top with the fresh scallions, jalapeño, and the soft boiled egg.
   Serve immediately. Enjoy!!</li>
